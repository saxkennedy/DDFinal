##About This Program:

This is a program designed for veteran and new D&D player who are wanting to jump right
into a game with a level 1 fighter but appreciate being able to customize their characters
without having to go through the hundreds of pages in the books of D&D character creation.
We also provide a savable pdf that will contain your filled out character sheet for your 
newly created character!

##Iteration 2:

#####Added Features
- Background selection
- Skill proficiency selection
- Filling of associated fields on PDF

This is the second iteration of the Level 1 Fighter D&D Character generator, it
includes updates to features such as; traversable UI, selectable races, selectable fighting
styles, selectable subraces, randomized dice rolling, and a pdf generator in which
you can save your file to any location desired. Provided under "User Stories" is 
the criteria in which we modeled our second iteration after. These are essential
features to the program and were our top priority when building a working program.
Under the "Acceptance Test Case" is a unique test designed by us to see if the
common person can traverse through our program and complete the requested goals.
Finally under "Acceptance Test Peer Thoughts" are a handful of responses we have
collected after asking the subject to perform the Acceptance Test mentioned previously.
This is insight that we will take into consideration when modeling the future iterations.


###User Story:

#####As a 5E D&D player, I want to make a level 1 fighter
- I will choose a name.
- I will choose a race from core 5E PHB.
    - I will choose a subrace if applicable
- I need the program to create random stats for me using traditional die-rolling methods, but give me the option to not use them.
- I will choose my fighting style.
- I will choose my background
- I will choose my skills
- I need to have the option to leave customization blank if I am undecided on something
- I need the ability to go back and change something if I change my mind

#####As a Dnd player, I require a character sheet to be filled out for me
- I need to choose whether to save this character sheet or not
    - I need to choose the location to save this file

###Acceptance Test Case:
1.  Can you create a character named “Trash Boat” that is a “Hill Dwarf” with 16 dexterity 
and has the “Archery” fighting style. Can you go back and change your character's name 
to “Dr.Pepper” and change your race to “Dragonborn”
2.  With a program that is already running and a character already created, can you save
 the generated pdf to the desktop
3.  Can you select and reselect skills and backgrounds?  In this case select Entertainer, then Animal Handling and Athletics.
Then go back and change your background to Urchin, and choose acrobatics and athletics.

###Acceptance Test Peer Thoughts
Acceptance Tester 1:

This acceptance test was very user friendly and I was able to complete it with no issues what so ever.
I loved being able to go back and change my abilities and other options when I decided to change my mind.
Overall I was satisfied with the program and could see myself or someone else using this.

Acceptance Tester 2:

The test I was given to preform was simple and straight forward. There was not a single page I didn't know
how to complete or not know what to expect. I would very much like to create my own fighter now and I feel
like this test gave me the tools to know how to easily traverse this program.

Acceptance Tester 3:

I completed the acceptance test a lot more smoothly than I originally thought I would because how clear the
interface was. If it weren't for the easy to read instructions and user friendly capability of the program,
I can see where there would be many issues. I really enjoyed the scrolling box with the backgrounds, that was
probably my favorite feature.

Acceptance Tester 4:

After completing the acceptance test given to me I can fairly say that it handles pretty smoothly and does a great
job of accomplishing its goal. The backgrounds were a nice addition to the program and Im glad to see how they went
about installing them into it.

Acceptance Tester 5:

After a few minutes of clicking through the program trying to complete the acceptance test, I managed to get through it. 
I really appreciated the nice UI design that made everything easy to find and made sure you had completed everything 
that was important to creating my character. I would like to see a feature to rename my pdf file to whatever I choose though.
